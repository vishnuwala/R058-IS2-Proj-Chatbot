## Chatbot using RL and Fuzzy Logic

This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The code includes the following functionalities:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Lemmatization and stopword removal using NLTK.
   - Word cloud visualization for data exploration.

2. **Encoding and Sequencing:**
   - Encoding words into numerical sequences for model input.
   - Padding sequences for uniform length.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network using Keras.
   - Training the model to predict responses based on input sequences.
     
4. **Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing using NLTK for lemmatization, stopword removal, and punctuation removal.
- Encoding text into numerical sequences for model training.
- LSTM model creation using Keras for response prediction.
- Integration of fuzzy logic for sentiment analysis using scikit-fuzzy.
- Visualization of data using WordCloud.
- User interaction via the command line interface.
- Fuzzy logic membership function implementation for sentiment analysis.
  
5. **Prediction and Interaction:**
   - Functions for predicting responses to user input.
   - Integration of fuzzy logic for input understanding.

6. **Evaluation and Testing:**
   - Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Implementation of A/B testing for real-world user evaluation.

7. **Additional Techniques:**
   - Integration of off-policy reinforcement learning (Q-learning) for adaptive decision-making.
   - Utilization of clustering algorithms (K-Means++) and GRU neural networks for enhanced response generation.

8. **Usage:**
   - Users can interact with the chatbot by providing input and receiving responses based on the trained model.
   - Testing and evaluation procedures are included for assessing the chatbot's performance.

9. **Dependencies:**
   - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, keras, wordcloud, scikit-fuzzy, sklearn are required libraries.
   - Ensure Python 3.x environment with the necessary packages installed.
